# Rha Content Website

We use the [Symfony Framework](http://symfony.com/what-is-symfony) along with several other [bundles](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/page_creation.html#page-creation-bundles)
I'm not going to delve into setting up or configuring Symfony as you can find all of the documentation online either 
at [Symfony Documentation][] or on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for each of the bundles we use.

## Server Setup

We're running on Linux.
See [setting up the server](https://github.com/RhaLabs/ProjectManagement/tree/master/src/LimeTrail/Bundle/Resources/doc/server_setup.md) for details.

## configuring Symfony and the webserver code

Be sure to have followed the steps outlined in the **Server Setup** section above.
Now you should be ready to get our website up and running. See [Configuring our code](https://github.com/RhaLabs/ProjectManagement/tree/master/src/LimeTrail/Bundle/Resources/doc/configure.md)

## Project Structure
The [Symfony Documentation][] has very good descriptions and instructions on how the Symfony ecosystem works and is organized.
I'm not going to attempt to recreate any of that here.  Instead I'm simply going to give a really coarse overview.
Ready?  head on over [here](https://github.com/RhaLabs/ProjectManagement/tree/master/src/LimeTrail/Bundle/Resources/doc/project_structure.md).
